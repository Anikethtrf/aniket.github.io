                    Plan Activities: Think about what you’d like to do together, whether it’s cooking a meal, watching a movie, or just chatting. Having a plan can reduce awkwardness.
                    Snacks and Drinks: Stock up on some snacks or drinks that you both enjoy. This can create a more relaxed atmosphere.</li>
